/*****************************************************************************
 *** SET THESE CONSTANTS, TO CONFIGURE THE BACKCHANNEL UART LIBRARY **********

1) Set the SMCLK speed and desired baudrate.

   The baudrate is determined by the UCA1BR0, UCA1BR1, and UCA1MCTL registers.
   UCA1MCTL has three relevant fields:  UCA1BRF, UCA1BRS, and UCOS16.  The
   settings below are for:
   SMCLK = 12MHz
   baudrate = 9600bps

   If you change the SMCLK speed, or want a different baudrate, you need to
   change these values.  An easy way to determine them is the calculator at
   the MSP430 wiki page:

http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/USCI_UART_Baud_Rate_Gen_Mode_Selection

   (If the link is somehow broken, the wiki page name is "USCI UART Baud Rate
   Gen Mode Selection", or try web-searching "msp430 usci calculator".
   Ultimately, the final reference is the UCS chapter of the F5xx Family User's
   Guide.) */

#define UCA1_OS   1    // 1 = oversampling mode, 0 = low-freq mode
#define UCA1_BR0  78   // Value of UCA1BR0 register
#define UCA1_BR1  0    // Value of UCA1BR1 register
#define UCA1_BRS  0    // Value of UCBRS field in UCA1MCTL register
#define UCA1_BRF  2    // Value of UCBRF field in UCA1MCTL register


// There is no hardware RTS/CTS handshaking in this example.  Your code must
// remain responsive to incoming UART data, to avoid overruns.


/*

2) If needed, re-configure the library's characteristics:

The size of the UART receive buffer.  Set smaller if RAM is in short supply.
Set larger if larger data chunks are to be received, or if the application
can't process incoming data very often   */

be less than BC_RXBUF_SIZE.  A value of '1' will alert main() whenever
even a single byte is received.  If no wake is desired, set to
BC_RXBUF_SIZE+1     */
